# Lucid – Your Legal Copilot 📄⚖️

**Simplify complex contracts into plain language, highlight risks, and ask questions like you would in a chat.**

---

## 🔍 Problem

Legal documents are filled with jargon and hidden clauses.  
Young professionals, students, and small businesses often sign contracts without truly understanding the risks.  
This leads to financial loss, unfair commitments, and lack of transparency.

---

## 💡 Solution

Lucid is an AI-powered legal copilot that makes documents clear and interactive:

- Upload a contract or legal PDF.
- Get a **plain-language summary** of what it means.
- See **line-by-line highlights** with risk labels:  
  🟥 High Risk | 🟨 Medium Risk | 🟩 Low Risk
- Ask questions in a **chat interface** and get grounded answers from the document.

- **Risk Highlights** – Red, yellow, green highlights directly on the text.
- **Clause Explanations** – Hover or click to see why a line matters.
- **Chat Copilot** – Ask: _"What happens if I don't pay?"_ → Lucid answers from the document.
